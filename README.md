### UTLP Appliance control
This is a **sample** code for UTLP kit(http://www.iwavesystems.com/unified-learning-kit.html) Which uses gpio ports to send control signals to the connected relay/switch/optocoupler to turn on/off the connected appliance. It also can be used netto trigger a SCR to control the duty cycle of it. UTLP uboot is buggy, and the ui cannot be drawn on screen without booting into linux. It uses the utlp config panes running on ubuntu as control interface. It can work if the utlp is connected to same subnet and has a static IP. This code is old and I wrote it years ago and I am just uploading it here if it can be used by anyone else. If I recall the documentation on the gpio ports/pins is a mess with a guess game.
there are two files one does data validation and second one doesn't (for the duty cycle selection)
